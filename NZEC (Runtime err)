NZEC stand for:- NON ZERO EXIT CODE 

This err generally encountered/occure in competitive coding .
This err occur because of when your code failed to return 0.
When your code return 0 that means your code is succesfully executed.
Otherwise it causes NZEC

REASONS OF NZEC ERR:

-> IN Python, Multiple Input can be defined separated by commas(for ex- x,y = input()) 
   but in online platform while testing input separated by spaces & int(input()) is not able to read the input properly & shows err NZEC.
 
-> If u ran out of stack memory .
-> Input & Output are not exactly same as test cases
-> This type of err also occur cause of code in which basic mistake like dividing by 0.
